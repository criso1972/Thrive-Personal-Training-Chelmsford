        <h2>Why Choose Personal Training at Thrive?</h2>
        <p>Generic gym routines often lead to frustration and plateaus. At Thrive Health & Fitness, our personal training programmes are built entirely around <em>you</em>. We take the time to understand your current fitness level, goals, lifestyle, and any limitations to create a truly effective and sustainable plan. Whether you prefer focused individual attention or the motivation of a small group, we have the right option for you.</p>

        <h3>One-on-One Personal Training</h3>
        <p>Receive undivided attention from your dedicated coach. This option is perfect for those with specific goals, injuries, or who prefer complete privacy. We tailor every aspect of your workout, provide constant feedback on form, and adjust your plan progressively to ensure continuous improvement and maximum results.</p>

        <h3>Semi-Private Coaching (1-4 People)</h3>
        <p>Train in a small, supportive group setting (maximum 4 people). This offers a balance of personalized attention and the motivating dynamic of training alongside others, often at a more accessible price point than one-on-one training. It's ideal for friends, couples, or individuals who enjoy a shared fitness experience while still receiving expert guidance.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of Our Personal Training Programmes:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personalized Plans:</strong> Workouts designed specifically for your body and goals (strength, weight loss, muscle gain, endurance, etc.).</li>
            <li><strong>Expert Guidance:</strong> Learn correct form and technique to maximize effectiveness and minimize injury risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Motivation & Accountability:</strong> Your coach keeps you inspired, focused, and on track towards your objectives.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficient Workouts:</strong> Get the most out of your time with structured sessions designed for optimal results.</li>
            <li><strong>Nutritional Support:</strong> Integrated advice to complement your training and accelerate progress (can link to Nutrition page).</li>
            <li><strong>Flexible Options:</strong> Choose between focused one-on-one sessions or motivating semi-private group training.</li>
            <li><strong>Progress Tracking:</strong> We monitor your improvements and adjust your plan accordingly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        <p>Your journey starts with a free consultation where we discuss your goals, health history, and conduct a basic movement assessment. Based on this, we recommend the best training option (one-on-one or semi-private) and outline your personalized plan. Each session builds upon the last, challenging you appropriately while ensuring you master the fundamentals.</p>
